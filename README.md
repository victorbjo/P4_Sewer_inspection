All the used files are in the AllCombined folder.
The script to run is the main.py, which will analyze all the pictures in the AllCombined/pictures folder.
All pictures used for testing is currently in the AllCombined/pictures folder.
In AllCombined a results.txt file present with all the results from initial testing.

If it is to be run again, delete the results.txt file first, since it will append results to this file

Most of the files are well documented with comments, but a lot of the code should also be self documenting and not need any comments
